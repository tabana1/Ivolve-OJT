## Shell Scripring Basics
Create a shell script that would ping every single server in the "192.168.1.x" subnet where x is the number between 0 and 255.

### Usage
1. clone the repository or download the `ping.sh` script to your local machine.
2. Make script executable :
    ```sh
    chmod +x ping.sh
    ```
3. Run the script 
    ```sh
    ./ping.sh
    ```
### Example Output 
    ```sh
    Server 192.168.1.63 is up and Running
    Server 192.168.1.64 is up and Running
    Server 192.168.1.65 is unreachable
    Server 192.168.1.66 is unreachable 
    ```
